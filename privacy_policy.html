    <h2>Email-Based Request Processing</h2>
    <p>
      Our app includes an optional email-based workflow for processing personal leave day (PLD) and single day vacation
      (SDV) requests. This system is designed to streamline request management while maintaining security and
      transparency.
    </p>

    <h3>How Email Processing Works</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When you submit a request through the app, an email is automatically sent to designated company administrators
        for processing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Company administrators can respond to these emails directly, and their responses are automatically processed and
        reflected in the app.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once processed, status change notifications are sent to both the requesting member and relevant division
        administrators.
      </li>
      <li>All email communications are tracked for delivery confirmation and administrative oversight.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Email Service Providers</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We use <strong>Mailgun</strong> as our primary email service provider for request processing emails. Mailgun's
        privacy policy is available at <a href="https://www.mailgun.com/privacy-policy">mailgun.com/privacy-policy</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        We use <strong>Resend</strong> as our backup email service provider. Resend's privacy policy is available at
        <a href="https://resend.com/legal/privacy-policy">resend.com/legal/privacy-policy</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Both services are used solely for delivering the email communications you have requested or that are necessary
        for app functionality.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Email Tracking and Monitoring</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We track email delivery status (sent, delivered, opened, failed) to ensure reliable communication and system
        monitoring.
      </li>
      <li>
        Email tracking data is used solely for operational purposes, troubleshooting delivery issues, and system
        reliability.
      </li>
      <li>
        Failed email deliveries trigger automatic retry mechanisms and administrative notifications to ensure no
        requests are lost.
      </li>
      <li>
        Division administrators can configure their preferred email addresses for receiving status change notifications.
      </li>
      <li>All email configuration changes are logged for auditing and transparency purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Email Content and Security</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Request emails contain only the information necessary for processing: request type, dates, member
        identification, and division information.
      </li>
      <li>
        All emails include unique identifiers to prevent processing errors and ensure proper correlation with app data.
      </li>
      <li>
        Email responses are processed through secure webhooks that verify authenticity and prevent unauthorized access.
      </li>
      <li>Sensitive information is never included in email subject lines or easily visible content.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Division Email Management</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Division administrators can configure primary and additional email addresses for receiving status change
        notifications.
      </li>
      <li>
        All email configuration changes are logged with timestamps and administrator identification for audit purposes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Division email settings can be enabled or disabled at any time through the app's administrative interface.
      </li>
      <li>
        Welcome emails are sent to newly configured division email addresses to verify deliverability and provide system
        information.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Email Workflow Data Retention</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Email tracking records are retained for operational and audit purposes in accordance with union record-keeping
        requirements.
      </li>
      <li>Email content is not permanently stored in our systems; only delivery status and metadata are retained.</li>
      <li>Audit logs for email configuration changes are retained for transparency and administrative oversight.</li>
      <li>
        Acknowledged email alerts and old tracking records are automatically cleaned up to maintain system performance.
      </li>
    </ul>
