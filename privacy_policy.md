# Privacy Policy for BLET PLD App

Last Updated: June 14, 2024

## Introduction

This privacy policy explains how the BLET PLD App collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application.

## Information We Collect

### Photo Gallery Access

- We request access to your device's photo gallery to allow you (as an Admin user) to select images for advertisements to upload to the app.
- We only access photos that you explicitly select through the system's photo picker.

### Camera Access

- Our app may request camera access to allow you to take photos directly within the app for creating advertisements or other content.
- Any photos taken using our app are stored on your device and are not automatically transmitted to our servers unless you explicitly upload them.

## How We Use Information

- Photos are only used for the specific purposes shown in the app, such as creating and displaying advertisements.
- We do not collect, store, or transmit your photos to external servers without your knowledge and explicit action.
- Your usage data may be collected anonymously to improve the app experience.

## Data Storage and Security

- User content primarily remains on your device unless you explicitly choose to share it through the app.
- When data is transmitted to our servers (such as when you create advertisements), we implement security measures to protect your information.
- We use Supabase for our backend services, which maintains high security standards for data storage and transmission.

## Third-Party Services

- We use Firebase for app analytics and notifications.
- Our app integrates with Expo services for updates and functionality.
- These services may collect anonymous usage data according to their respective privacy policies.

## User Rights

- You can choose not to grant photo or camera permissions, though this may limit some app functionality.
- You can request information about your data or request deletion by contacting us.

## Changes to This Policy

- We may update this privacy policy periodically. Significant changes will be notified within the app.
- The latest version will always be available within the app and on our website.
