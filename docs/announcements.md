# Announcements Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation strategy for adding Announcements functionality to the application. The entire system will be developed progressively in phases with review pauses after each phase completion. Announcements will be managed by division, union, and application admins and displayed to members based on their respective divisions or union-wide.

**Note on UI Development**: Utilize existing UI components and styling consistent with the current application theme and usage. **Always search the codebase for suitable existing components before creating new ones.**

**Implementation Approach**: We will implement phases sequentially and pause after each phase for review before proceeding to the next phase.

### Key Features

1. **Multiple levels of announcements**:

   - Division level (managed by `division_admin` for their specific division(s), union_admin and application_admin can access via the divisionSelector for divisions they are not a part of)
   - GCA/Union level (managed by `union_admin` or `application_admin`)

2. **Admin management interfaces**:

   - Division Admin Dashboard → Division Management → Announcements (CRUD for own division, view read/unread status for division members)
   - Union Admin Dashboard → Union Announcements (Tabbed interface for managing GCA and all division announcements)
   - Application Admin: Full control via appropriate interfaces.
   - **Company Admin: NO ACCESS** to announcements (as specified)

3. **Announcement content**:

   - Title
   - Description/message
   - Optional links
   - Optional document attachments (integrated into the creation flow using existing document upload/viewer components)

4. **Read tracking and notification**:

   - Track which users have read announcements (implicitly upon viewing/scrolling) using same pin number pattern as existing message system
   - Badge notifications for unread announcements using existing badgeStore with different categories
   - Badge notifications on navigation elements:
     - "My Division" navigation card (Blue badge)
     - "GCA" navigation card (Green badge)
     - "Announcements" sub-navigation card under "My Division" (Blue badge)
     - "GCA Announcements" sub-navigation card under "GCA" (Green badge)

5. **Integration with existing systems**:
   - Similar to member messages, NOT admin messages
   - Use existing document storage through Supabase Storage with existing upload/viewer components
   - Follow existing division context validation patterns from divisionMeetingStore
   - Initialize immediately after notification store (before calendar/vacation/time stores) in useAuth sequence for priority loading
   - Use existing deep linking patterns for navigation
   - Use existing badge system with different categories for announcement badges

## Summary of Division Context Integration

### Key Changes Made to Prevent Cross-Contamination

Based on the division context implementation in the meetings system (`meetings.tsx` and `divisionMeetingStore.ts`), the following critical patterns have been incorporated into the announcements plan:

#### 1. **Store Architecture Changes**

- **Data Organization**: Announcements stored by division context (`Record<string, Announcement[]>`) instead of flat array
- **Division Context Tracking**: Added `currentDivisionContext` state variable to track active division
- **Context Validation**: Added `validateAnnouncementDivisionContext()` helper function
- **Error Handling**: Added `handleAnnouncementDivisionError()` for contextual error messages

#### 2. **Database Query Filtering**

- **Division-Scoped Queries**: All announcement fetches include division context filters
- **Pattern from meetings**: `fetchDivisionAnnouncements(divisionName)` follows `fetchDivisionMeetings(divisionName)` pattern
- **RLS Policy Enhancement**: Database policies must validate division context for all operations
- **Query Optimization**: Use division IDs in WHERE clauses to prevent data leakage

#### 3. **Realtime Subscription Filtering**

- **Context-Aware Subscriptions**: Realtime channels scoped to specific divisions
- **Change Validation**: Incoming realtime changes validated against current division context
- **Pattern from meetings**: Channel naming with division suffix (`announcements-changes-${divisionName}`)
- **Subscription Cleanup**: Proper cleanup when division context changes

#### 4. **Component-Level Validation**

- **Props-Based Context**: All components receive `divisionContext` prop for validation
- **Render Guards**: Components validate announcements belong to current context before rendering
- **Route Parameter Validation**: Division screens validate user belongs to accessed division
- **Pattern from meetings**: Division name from route params used for all context operations

#### 5. **UI State Management**

- **Context-Scoped Loading**: Loading states include division context information
- **Badge Filtering**: Unread counts filtered by division context
- **Navigation Guards**: Prevent access to unauthorized division content
- **Error Boundaries**: Division-specific error handling and display

#### 6. **Critical Implementation Points**

**Following Exact Patterns from `meetings.tsx`:**

```typescript
// 1. Route parameter extraction and validation
const params = useLocalSearchParams();
const divisionName = params.divisionName as string;

// 2. Division context setting in useEffect
useEffect(() => {
  if (divisionName) {
    setDivisionContext(divisionName);
    fetchDivisionAnnouncements(divisionName);
  }
}, [divisionName, setDivisionContext, fetchDivisionAnnouncements]);

// 3. Realtime subscription with division context
useEffect(() => {
  const cleanup = subscribeToAnnouncements(divisionName);
  return cleanup;
}, [divisionName, subscribeToAnnouncements]);

// 4. Data access with division key
const divisionAnnouncements = announcements[divisionName] || [];
```

**Following Exact Patterns from `divisionMeetingStore.ts`:**

```typescript
// 1. Store state organization
announcements: Record<string, Announcement[]>; // By division name
currentDivisionContext: string | null;

// 2. Division context validation
const validateAnnouncementDivisionContext = async (
  announcementId: string,
  expectedDivisionName?: string
): Promise<boolean> => {
  // Validation logic following meetings pattern
};

// 3. Realtime filtering
if (divisionId && changeTargetDivisionIds && !changeTargetDivisionIds.includes(divisionId)) {
  console.log(`[Realtime] Ignoring change for different division`);
  return;
}
```

#### 7. **Database Schema Considerations**

- **Target Division IDs**: Use `target_division_ids` array for precise division targeting
- **Context Validation Functions**: Database functions must validate division context
- **RLS Policy Updates**: Policies must prevent cross-division data access
- **Query Optimization**: Indices on division-related columns for performance

#### 8. **Testing Requirements**

- **Division Isolation Tests**: Verify announcements don't leak between divisions
- **Context Switching Tests**: Ensure proper cleanup when changing division context
- **Unauthorized Access Tests**: Verify users can't access other divisions' announcements
- **Realtime Filtering Tests**: Confirm realtime updates respect division boundaries

### Migration from Existing Systems

If implementing this on an existing system without division context:

1. **Audit Existing Data**: Identify any cross-contamination in current data
2. **Gradual Migration**: Implement division context validation incrementally
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing functionality continues during migration
4. **Data Cleanup**: Remove any announcements that don't belong to their target divisions
5. **User Communication**: Inform users about improved data isolation

### Performance Considerations

- **Query Optimization**: Division-scoped queries are more efficient than global queries
- **Subscription Management**: Fewer realtime subscriptions per user (only their division)
- **Cache Efficiency**: Division-scoped caching reduces memory usage
- **Network Traffic**: Reduced data transfer due to precise filtering

This division context integration ensures that the announcements system maintains the same level of data isolation and security as the meetings system, preventing any cross-contamination of division information.

## Summary

The announcements feature implementation plan is now complete and ready for implementation. The plan incorporates:

✅ **Database Migration Strategy**: 2-3 separate migrations for easier rollback  
✅ **Badge Store Extension**: Extended existing badgeStore for all announcement badges  
✅ **NavigationCard Enhancement**: Extended for future badge extensibility  
✅ **Document Integration**: Using existing document components as-is  
✅ **Acknowledgment Patterns**: Reusing existing modal and acknowledgment UX  
✅ **Division Context Security**: Following exact patterns from meetings system  
✅ **Phase-by-Phase Implementation**: With review pauses after each phase

The implementation will proceed through 6 phases:

1. **Database Schema Design** (3 migrations)
2. **State Management** (Zustand store with division context)
3. **UI Component Extensions** (NavigationCard, badges, modals)
4. **Member UI** (Division and GCA announcement viewing)
5. **Admin UI** (Management interfaces for all admin types)
6. **Testing and Deployment** (Manual testing after each phase)

All clarifications have been incorporated and the plan is ready for implementation.

**useAuth.tsx Integration (Phase 2):**

```typescript
// In the initializeUserStores function, update the initialization order comment and sequence:

// UPDATED INITIALIZATION ORDER: Notification Store → Announcements Store → Calendar → Vacation Calendar → Time Store → Admin Store
// This prioritizes urgent user-facing content while other stores initialize

// 1. Initialize notification store for the user
const notificationStore = useNotificationStore.getState();
if (!notificationStore.isInitialized) {
  console.log("[Auth] Initializing notification store...");
  const notificationCleanup = notificationStore.subscribeToMessages(userId);
  notificationCleanupRef.current = notificationCleanup;
  await notificationStore.fetchMessages(userId, userId);
  console.log("[Auth] Notification store initialized");
}

// 2. Initialize announcement store immediately after notifications (NEW)
const announcementStore = useAnnouncementStore.getState();
if (!announcementStore.isInitialized) {
  console.log("[Auth] Initializing announcement store...");
  const announcementCleanup = announcementStore.initializeAnnouncementStore(
    userId,
    member?.division_id || null,
    roles || []
  );
  announcementCleanupRef.current = announcementCleanup;
  console.log("[Auth] Announcement store initialized");
}

// 3. Initialize calendar store (if calendarId available)
// ... rest of existing calendar/vacation/time initialization
```

**Cleanup Integration:**

```typescript
// Add to runCleanupActions function:
if (announcementCleanupRef.current) {
  console.log("[Auth] Cleaning up announcement subscription...");
  announcementCleanupRef.current();
  announcementCleanupRef.current = null;
}

// Add to reset flags:
useAnnouncementStore.getState().setIsInitialized(false);
```
