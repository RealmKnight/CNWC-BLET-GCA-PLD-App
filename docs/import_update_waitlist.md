# Import Update Waitlist - Over-Allotment Detection & Drag-and-Drop Management

## Overview

Enhance the iCal import system to detect over-allotment situations where imported requests exceed calendar allotments, and provide a drag-and-drop interface for admins to manage approval/waitlist priorities.

## Priority Order (Updated)

1. **Unmatched Members** (highest priority - needs admin action to proceed)
2. **Duplicate Requests** (resolve duplicates before allotment calculations)
3. **Over-Allotment Situations** (after duplicates resolved, manage approval/waitlist priority)
4. **Database Reconciliation** (compare DB vs iCal, handle missing calendar entries)
5. **Final Review & Import** (execute with full validation)

## Staged Import Preview Workflow

### Overview

The staged import preview workflow provides a comprehensive, step-by-step approach to importing PLD/SDV requests from iCal files. This workflow ensures data integrity, prevents conflicts, and gives administrators full control over the import process.

### Workflow Stages

#### Stage 1: Unmatched Member Resolution

- **Purpose**: Resolve requests that couldn't be automatically matched to existing members
- **Actions**: Search for correct members, assign matches, or skip invalid requests
- **Validation**: All unmatched items must be resolved or skipped to proceed

#### Stage 2: Duplicate Detection ⭐ **CRITICAL FIRST**

- **Purpose**: Identify and resolve duplicate requests before allotment calculations
- **Why First**: Duplicates aren't separate requests - they're the same request already in the database
- **Actions**:
  - Compare import requests with existing database entries
  - Choose to skip duplicates (recommended) or override if truly separate
  - Prevent double-counting in allotment calculations
- **Benefits**:
  - Accurate allotment calculations (no phantom requests)
  - Prevents data conflicts and integrity issues
  - Cleaner over-allotment analysis with only unique requests

#### Stage 3: Over-Allotment Review

- **Purpose**: Handle dates where unique requests exceed available allotments
- **Actions**:
  - Review over-allotted dates (after filtering out duplicates)
  - Drag-and-drop to set request priority
  - Adjust allotments or manage waitlists
- **Benefits**: Works with accurate request counts after duplicate removal

#### Stage 4: Database Reconciliation

- **Purpose**: Compare existing DB requests with iCal import and resolve discrepancies
- **Actions**:
  - Review DB requests not found in iCal import
  - Handle same request/different status conflicts
  - Modify existing DB request statuses as needed
  - Re-trigger over-allotment analysis if DB changes affect calculations
- **Benefits**: Ensures database becomes source of truth, handles manual entries not in calendar

#### Stage 5: Final Review

- **Purpose**: Review final import summary including DB reconciliation and execute the operation
- **Actions**: Confirm all decisions including DB changes and execute the import
- **Validation**: Final integrity checks including reconciliation impact before database changes

### Key Improvements

#### Logical Flow Enhancement

The new stage order (Unmatched → **Duplicates** → Over-Allotment → Final Review) provides:

1. **Accurate Data Foundation**: Duplicates are resolved before any calculations
2. **Proper Allotment Analysis**: Over-allotment calculations use only unique, valid requests
3. **Reduced Complexity**: No need to recalculate allotments after duplicate removal
4. **Better User Experience**: Clear decision points without conflicting information

#### Duplicate-First Benefits

- **Data Integrity**: Prevents importing the same request twice
- **Accurate Metrics**: Allotment calculations reflect true request volume
- **Cleaner Decisions**: Over-allotment management works with actual unique requests
- **Conflict Prevention**: Eliminates database constraint violations from duplicates

### Technical Implementation

#### Stage Transition Logic

```typescript
// Updated stage order with DB reconciliation
const stageOrder: ImportStage[] = [
  "unmatched",
  "duplicates",
  "over_allotment",
  "db_reconciliation", // ← New stage before final review
  "final_review",
];
```

#### Over-Allotment Analysis Enhancement

```typescript
// Filter out duplicates before allotment calculations
const itemsToAnalyze = originalItems.filter((item, index) => {
  if (unmatched.skippedItems.has(index)) return false;
  if (duplicates.skipDuplicates.has(index)) return false; // ← New filter
  return item.matchedMember.status === "matched" || unmatched.resolvedAssignments[index];
});
```

#### Validation Updates

- Stage transition validation updated for new order
- Data integrity checks account for duplicate filtering
- Progress metrics reflect accurate stage completion

### User Interface Updates

#### Stage Navigation

- Progress bar reflects new order
- Stage help content updated for duplicate-first approach
- Loading states and transitions updated

#### Enhanced Guidance

- "How Staged Import Works" guide updated
- Stage-specific help emphasizes duplicate importance
- Warnings about duplicate decisions and their impact

### Migration Considerations

#### Existing Imports

- Legacy quick import mode remains unchanged
- Staged import uses new order for all new imports
- No impact on existing database data

#### User Training

- Updated documentation reflects new workflow
- Stage help provides clear guidance on duplicate decisions
- Emphasis on "skip duplicates" as the safe default choice

## Implementation Notes

### Key Technical Decisions

- **Staged Progression**: Each stage must be 100% complete before advancing
- **Re-Analysis Pipeline**: Automatic data re-analysis after each stage completion
- **Data Integrity**: Multiple validation layers to prevent inconsistent imports
- **User Control**: Ability to navigate back with appropriate warnings
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained existing quick import workflow alongside new staged import
- Using `react-native-draggable-flatlist` for cross-platform drag-and-drop
- Maintaining consistency with existing `waitlist_position` database field
- Preserving original iCal status information for admin reference

### Database Considerations

- No schema changes required - using existing `waitlist_position` field
- Allotment queries will use existing `pld_sdv_allotments` table
- Import operations will use existing batch insert patterns
- **Transaction Safety**: Each stage completion creates a safe checkpoint

### UX Principles

- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show only relevant data for current stage
- **Clear Progression**: Visual indicators of stage completion and requirements
- **Data Integrity First**: Block progression until stage requirements are met
- **Reversible Actions**: Allow going back with appropriate warnings
- **Mode Selection**: Clear choice between advanced staged import and simple quick import
- Intuitive drag-and-drop with immediate visual feedback
- Consistent with existing admin interface patterns

- ✅ Added screen reader support with proper announcements and hints
- ✅ Enhanced visual hierarchy and component styling throughout the interface
- ✅ Created quick tips and best practices for each import stage
- ✅ Implemented time estimation and progress tracking for user feedback

**Phase 8 Rationale**:
The staged import workflow was missing a critical component - reconciliation with existing database requests that aren't reflected in the iCal import. This could lead to:

- Over-allotment situations not being detected (existing approved requests not counted)
- Waitlist position conflicts (existing waitlisted requests not considered)
- Data integrity issues (manual approvals being overwritten)
- Incomplete allotment calculations (missing existing request data)

Phase 8 addresses these concerns by adding comprehensive database reconciliation and conflict detection before final import execution.
