Last Updated: January 16, 2025

## Introduction

This privacy policy explains how the BLET PLD App collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information.

## Information We Collect

### Photo Gallery Access

- We request access to your device's photo gallery to allow you (as an Admin user) to select images for advertisements to upload to the app.
- We only access photos that you explicitly select through the system's photo picker.

### Camera Access

- Our app may request camera access to allow you to take photos directly within the app for creating advertisements or other content.
- Any photos taken using our app are stored on your device and are not automatically transmitted to our servers unless you explicitly upload them.

### Mobile Phone Number

- If you opt in to receive SMS notifications, we collect and store your mobile phone number.
- Your mobile phone number is used SOLELY for sending you the notifications you have explicitly requested.
- We DO NOT sell, rent, lease, or share your mobile phone number with any third parties or affiliates for marketing or promotional purposes.
- Your mobile phone number is only shared with Twilio, our SMS service provider, for the sole purpose of delivering the notifications you have requested.

## How We Use Information

- Photos are only used for the specific purposes shown in the app, such as creating and displaying advertisements.
- We do not collect, store, or transmit your photos to external servers without your knowledge and explicit action.
- Your usage data may be collected anonymously to improve the app experience.
- We DO NOT use your mobile phone number or any other personal information for marketing purposes beyond what you have explicitly consented to.

## Data Storage and Security

- User content primarily remains on your device unless you explicitly choose to share it through the app.
- When data is transmitted to our servers (such as when you create advertisements), we implement security measures to protect your information.
- We use Supabase for our backend services, which maintains high security standards for data storage and transmission.
- Your mobile phone number is stored securely and is accessible only to authorized personnel who need it to provide the services you have requested.

## Email-Based Request Processing

Our app includes an optional email-based workflow for processing personal leave day (PLD) and single day vacation (SDV) requests. This system is designed to streamline request management while maintaining security and transparency.

### How Email Processing Works

- When you submit a request through the app, an email is automatically sent to designated company administrators for processing.
- Company administrators can respond to these emails directly, and their responses are automatically processed and reflected in the app.
- Once processed, status change notifications are sent to both the requesting member and relevant division administrators.
- All email communications are tracked for delivery confirmation and administrative oversight.

### Email Service Providers

- We use **Mailgun** as our primary email service provider for request processing emails. Mailgun's privacy policy is available at [mailgun.com/privacy-policy](https://www.mailgun.com/privacy-policy).
- We use **Resend** as our backup email service provider. Resend's privacy policy is available at [resend.com/legal/privacy-policy](https://resend.com/legal/privacy-policy).
- Both services are used solely for delivering the email communications you have requested or that are necessary for app functionality.

### Email Tracking and Security

- We track email delivery status (sent, delivered, opened, failed) to ensure reliable communication and system monitoring.
- Email tracking data is used solely for operational purposes, troubleshooting delivery issues, and system reliability.
- Failed email deliveries trigger automatic retry mechanisms and administrative notifications to ensure no requests are lost.
- Request emails contain only the information necessary for processing and include unique identifiers to prevent processing errors.
- Division administrators can configure their preferred email addresses for receiving status change notifications.
- All email configuration changes are logged for auditing and transparency purposes.
