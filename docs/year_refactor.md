# Year-Aware Time-Off Calculations Refactor Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to implement year-aware time-off calculations to properly handle cross-year requests (e.g., requesting January 1, 2025 from July 2024). Currently, the system shows incorrect available day counts when requesting days in future years.

## Problem Statement

- Users requesting next year dates see current year's remaining allocation instead of next year's fresh allocation
- System validates against wrong year's data, potentially blocking valid requests
- No distinction between current year exhausted days vs. next year fresh allocation
- Confusing UX when showing "0 Available PLD Days" for next year requests

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Users can see correct available days for any selectable year (current, next)
- [ ] RequestDialog shows year-specific allocations (e.g., "Available 2025 PLD Days: 13")
- [ ] Validation works correctly across year boundaries
- [ ] Six-month requests work seamlessly across year transitions
- [ ] PLD rollover logic remains intact for current year
- [ ] Admin tools properly display year-specific data

## ‚öñÔ∏è **OFFICIAL DESIGN DECISION: CONSERVATIVE APPROACH**

**ADOPTED**: Option B - Conservative Calculation for Next Year Requests

**Formula**: `Next Year Available Days = Next Year Max PLDs + Next Year SDV Allocation`

**Exclusions**: Current year remaining PLDs are NOT included in next year calculations

**Rationale**:

- Prevents over-booking scenarios where users schedule more than guaranteed allocation
- Users planning to save PLDs typically schedule bulk requests after Q1 anyway
- Rollover PLDs (used in Q1) are separate from strategic mid/late-year planning
- Builds trust through guaranteed minimum allocations rather than projections

## Phase 1: Foundation & Analysis üîç

### 1.1 System Analysis ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

- [x] Document current time calculation flow in detail
- [x] Identify all places where year assumptions exist
- [x] Map out database tables/fields involved in time calculations
- [x] Document current validation rules and their year dependencies
- [x] Identify all UI components that display available days

**KEY FINDINGS:**

- **TimeStore**: Fetches only current year data using `${currentYear}-01-01` to `${currentYear}-12-31`
- **Year Assumptions**: All calculations currently hardcoded to `new Date().getFullYear()`
- **Database Tables**: `pld_sdv_requests`, `six_month_requests`, `members` - ready for year filtering
- **Validation**: `check_available_pld_sdv_days` trigger needs year-aware logic
- **UI Components**: RequestDialog, MyTime, TimeOffManager need year detection

### 1.2 Year Calculation Rules Definition ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

- [x] **OFFICIAL DECISION**: Conservative approach for next year calculations to prevent over-booking
- [x] **DEFINED**: Next Year Available Days = Next Year Max PLDs + Next Year SDV Allocation (NO current remaining PLDs)
- [x] **DEFINED**: PLD rollover occurs Dec 31 at 23:59, rolled-over PLDs are ADDED to max PLDs for total available days (NOT affecting max_plds field)
- [x] **DEFINED**: Current year remaining PLDs are NOT included in next year availability calculations
- [x] **DEFINED**: Six-month requests for next year count against next year's available days only
- [x] **DEFINED**: Only show year context when requesting next year dates (e.g., "2025 Available PLD Days: 13")
- [x] **DEFINED**: SDVs for future years use `sdv_election` field (for next year vacation split decision)
- [x] **DEFINED**: Vacation week calculations use anniversary-aware logic for target year
- [x] **DEFINED**: Anniversary date handling uses target year to determine effective years of service
- [x] **DEFINED**: Only support current year + next year (6-month max range)

**BUSINESS RULES ESTABLISHED:**

- **Conservative Calculations**: Next year shows only guaranteed fresh allocation
- **Year Context**: UI shows year only when requesting future year dates
- **Rollover Separation**: Rollover PLDs separate from advance request calculations

### 1.3 Database Function Updates ‚úÖ **INVESTIGATION COMPLETE**

- [x] **FOUND**: `check_available_pld_sdv_days` - Main validation trigger (BEFORE INSERT on pld_sdv_requests) **NEEDS UPDATE**
- [x] **FOUND**: `calculate_member_available_plds` - ‚úÖ **ALREADY YEAR-AWARE** (has both single and dual parameter versions)
- [x] **FOUND**: `update_member_max_plds` - Updates max PLDs based on anniversary (already year-aware) ‚úÖ
- [x] **FOUND**: `get_member_remaining_days` - ‚úÖ **ALREADY YEAR-AWARE** but anniversary logic needs refinement for target year
- [x] **FOUND**: `validate_allotment_change` - ‚úÖ **ALREADY WORKS** (validates by date, inherently year-aware)
- [x] **FOUND**: `check_allotment_and_set_status` - ‚úÖ **ALREADY WORKS** (uses request_date for year extraction)
- [x] **FOUND**: `process_q1_pld_request` - ‚úÖ **ALREADY WORKS** (year-aware via date calculations)
- [x] **FOUND**: `calculate_pld_rollover` - ‚úÖ **ALREADY YEAR-AWARE** (has both single and dual parameter versions)

**CRITICAL FINDINGS:**

- **PRIMARY ISSUE**: `check_available_pld_sdv_days` uses `sdv_entitlement` instead of `sdv_election` for next year
- **SECONDARY ISSUE**: `get_member_remaining_days` uses `CURRENT_DATE` for anniversary instead of target year date
- **GOOD NEWS**: Most functions already handle years properly through date-based logic

### 2.3 Validation Logic Updates ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

- [x] **CREATED**: `get_member_sdv_allocation_for_year(member_id, year)` - Uses `sdv_entitlement` for current year, `sdv_election` for next year
- [x] **CREATED**: `get_member_total_pld_allocation_for_year(member_id, year)` - Anniversary-aware PLD calculations with rollover for current year only
- [x] **UPDATED**: `check_available_pld_sdv_days` to handle year-aware SDV calculations and conservative PLD approach
- [x] **UPDATED**: `get_member_remaining_days` to use target year for anniversary calculations instead of `CURRENT_DATE`

- [x] **TESTED**: All functions verified with sample member data - conservative approach working correctly
- [x] **VERIFIED**: Next year calculations show only fresh allocation (no current year remaining PLDs included)

**KEY IMPROVEMENTS:**

- **Year-Aware SDV**: Current year uses `sdv_entitlement`, next year uses `sdv_election`
- **Anniversary-Aware PLDs**: Proper years of service calculation for target year instead of current date
- **Conservative Approach**: Next year shows only guaranteed fresh allocation (13 PLDs for senior members)
- **Rollover Handling**: Current year includes rollover PLDs, future years start fresh
- **Consistency**: All validation functions now use same year-aware calculation logic

### 2.4 Cron Job Implementation (Performance Optimization)

- [ ] **SUGGESTED**: Add `nextyear_plds` field to members table for caching pre-calculated next year PLDs
- [ ] **CONSERVATIVE RULE**: Pre-calculate next year allocation using ONLY next year's fresh max PLDs + SDV

- [x] Test six-month requests requested in July for January dates
- [ ] Document any special handling needed for six-month cross-year scenarios

### 5.2 PLD Rollover Logic ‚úÖ **CLARIFIED - CONSERVATIVE APPROACH ADOPTED**

- [x] **OFFICIAL DECISION**: Conservative approach - rollover PLDs NOT included in next year request calculations
- [x] **DEFINED**: PLD rollover occurs Dec 31 at 23:59, SDVs submitted for pay-in-lieu
- [x] **DEFINED**: Rolled-over PLDs must be used within first quarter of next year, otherwise paid out
- [x] **CORRECTED**: Rollover PLDs are ADDED to max PLDs for total available (e.g., 13 max + 4 rollover = 17 available)
- [x] **CORRECTED**: Rollover PLDs do NOT affect the max_plds field itself - they are over and above max PLDs
- [x] **CONSERVATIVE RULE**: Next year request availability shows ONLY next year's fresh allocation (max PLDs + SDV)
- [x] **RATIONALE**: Prevents over-booking scenarios where users schedule more than guaranteed allocation
- [x] **CLARIFICATION**: 4 rollover PLDs with 13 max = 17 total available, but requests show only 13 PLD days
- [x] Verify next year calculations start fresh (no rollover from future years)
- [x] Test rollover logic during year transitions
- [x] Document rollover interaction with year-aware calculations (separated from request availability)
